# Wallpapers

A collection of wallpapers for **labwc**, Bunsenlabs and various others.

### How are they made?

Not with **gimp** or any other image editor!

They are generated with `mkwallpaper`. It is a `pangocairo` application
written in `C` specifically for `linux` based OS but _may_ build and run
in any `unix` style OS.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/01micko/mkwallpaper)
